## Employee Payroll Tracker Goal
This project's goal was to create an employee payroll tracker using javascript. I wrote the code collecting the employee data using a function. I et the data to be true so I could use a while if statement. I made sure to put a break so that it would stop each loop in the while if statement. Then I used push to to send the info to the table. I made sure to use return to stop the employee info from being added when cancel is chosen after every employee has been entered. I added a for statement in a function to calculate the total salary of all employees. I console logged the the average salary. FInally I console logged a random employee for the drawing.
